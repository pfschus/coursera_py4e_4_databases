    "# Relational Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Used for accessing random access memory in a smart way. Rather than scanning through all the data until you get to the part you want, go straight there.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Database**: contains many tables  \n",
    "* **Relation (or table)**: contains tuples and attributes  \n",
    "* **Tuple (or row)**: a set of fields that generally represents an \"object\" like a person or a music track  \n",
    "* **Attribute (also column or field)**: one of possibly many elements of data corresponding to the object represented by the row  \n",
    "\n",
    "People in mathematics will use the terminology relation, tuple, and attribute. Coders tend to say table, row, column/field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oracle (the company) developed most of this. They beat out a lot of other companies like IBM because they were willing to do the math to get relational databases to work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think about a database as a giant Excel file. The sheets are the tables. Each table has rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL** (structured query language) is the language we use to issue commands to the database. \n",
    "* Ex: create a table, retrieve some data, import data, delete data (CRUD)  \n",
    "* SQL was decided on by several big industry companies and NIST.  \n",
    "* SQL is a beautiful language because it is simple and can do a lot. However, it requires the data to be really well organized.  \n",
    "* Python is better at handling messy data, so Python and SQL make a good team.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Roles**: There are generally two major roles in a large project:  \n",
    "* Application developer- builds the logic for the application, including the look and feel, and monitors the app for problems.  \n",
    "* Database administrator- Monitors and adjusts the database as the program runs in production. They may have specialized database tools to talk straight to the database, instead of going through SQL.  \n",
    "* Both people may participate in the building of the \"data model\"  \n",
    "**Database model / schema**: This is like your contract- an agreement for how you will build the database. It's the structure or format of a database, described in a formal language supported by the database management system. \n",
    "\n",
    "**SQLite**: built-in to a lot of applications directly. It is written in python. It's fast and aimed at smaller pieces of data. Import it in python directly.  "
