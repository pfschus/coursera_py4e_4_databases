    "* **FIRST TABLE**: Tracks  \n",

    "    * Which columns are attributes of the track? length, rating, count.  \n",
    "    * Columns in first table: track title / length / rating / count  \n",
    "* **SECOND TABLE**: Albums    \n",
    "    * What's the next thing to draw? Go to the albums. Tracks belong to albums, then albums belong to artists.  \n",
    "* **OTHER COLUMNS**\n",
    "    * Where does genre belong? Is it connected to an album, artist, or track? In most music software, changing the genre only affects that one track. So go back and add genre to the original track table. \n",
    "* **ID Key**  \n",
    "    * Add a primary key to each table. The primary key in each table is unique to that table only.  \n",
    "        * There is one key for every row.  \n",
    "        * When you set up the table, you can set it as a primary key, and tell it to auto increment so it automatically numbers up starting at 1.  \n",
    "    * If you want to link to another table, you can add a foreign key, which points to the primary key of another table. Name this key in a descriptive way.   \n",
    "    * A logical key is a way of setting up a relationship that you might use  \n",
